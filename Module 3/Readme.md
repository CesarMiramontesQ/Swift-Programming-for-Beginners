## Module 3: Object-Oriented Programming with Swift

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and behavior. OOP is used to model real-world objects and interactions, and to organize code into reusable and maintainable components. Swift is a powerful object-oriented programming language that provides a rich set of features for creating and working with objects.

### Classes and Objects

In Swift, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. A class defines a set of properties and methods that describe the behavior of objects created from the class. Objects are instances of a class, and they contain values for the properties defined by the class.

### Properties and Methods

Properties are variables that belong to an object, and they represent the state of the object. Methods are functions that belong to an object, and they represent the behavior of the object. In Swift, properties and methods are defined inside a class.

### Inheritance and Polymorphism

Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from a parent class. The child class can then add its own properties and methods, or override the ones inherited from the parent class. Polymorphism is a feature of inheritance that allows a child class to be used as an instance of its parent class.

### Protocols and Extensions

Protocols are a way to define a set of requirements that a class, structure, or enumeration must conform to. Protocols are similar to interfaces in other programming languages, and they allow code to be written in a generic and reusable way. Extensions are a way to add functionality to an existing class, structure, or enumeration, without modifying its source code.

In this module, students will learn how to create classes and objects in Swift, define properties and methods, use inheritance and polymorphism, define protocols and extensions, and create generic code using protocols. They will also learn how to apply object-oriented design principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, to create well-organized and maintainable code.
