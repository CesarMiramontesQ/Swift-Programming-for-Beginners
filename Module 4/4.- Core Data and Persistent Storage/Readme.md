### Core Data and Persistent Storage

Core Data is a powerful framework provided by Apple for managing persistent storage in iOS and macOS applications. It provides a layer of abstraction over SQLite and other low-level database management systems, making it easier for developers to work with local data storage. Core Data is widely used in iOS and macOS applications to store user data, settings, and preferences.

#### Defining Data Models

In Core Data, data models are used to describe the objects that will be stored in the database. The data model can be created using the Core Data Model Editor, which is integrated into Xcode. The data model consists of entities, attributes, and relationships between objects.

Here is an example of a data model for a simple to-do list app:

In this example, we have defined a single entity named `Task` with three attributes: `title`, `dueDate`, and `isComplete`. We have also defined a relationship between `Task` and `Category`, which is another entity in the data model.

#### Saving Data

To save data to the local database, we need to create instances of the entity classes defined in the data model and set their properties. We then add these instances to the `NSManagedObjectContext` and call the `save()` method to commit the changes to the database.

Here is an example of how to save a new `Task` to the database:

```swift
// Get the managed object context
let context = (UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate).persistentContainer.viewContext

// Create a new Task object
let newTask = Task(context: context)

// Set the properties of the Task object
newTask.title = "Buy groceries"
newTask.dueDate = Date()
newTask.isComplete = false

// Add the new Task to the context and save the changes
context.insert(newTask)
do {
    try context.save()
} catch {
    print("Error saving task: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

#### Retrieving Data

To retrieve data from the local database, we use `NSFetchRequest`, which allows us to specify filtering and sorting criteria. We then execute the fetch request using the `NSManagedObjectContext` and get back an array of objects that match the criteria.

Here is an example of how to retrieve all `Task` objects from the database:

```swift
// Get the managed object context
let context = (UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate).persistentContainer.viewContext

// Create a fetch request for all tasks
let fetchRequest: NSFetchRequest<Task> = Task.fetchRequest()

do {
    // Execute the fetch request
    let tasks = try context.fetch(fetchRequest)
    
    // Process the tasks
    for task in tasks {
        print("\(task.title!) - due on \(task.dueDate!)")
    }
} catch {
    print("Error fetching tasks: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

#### Updating and Deleting Data

To update an existing object in the database, we need to retrieve it using `NSFetchRequest`, update its properties, and then call `save()` on the `NSManagedObjectContext`.

Here is an example of how to update the `title` of an existing `Task` object:

```swift
// Get the managed object context
let context = (UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate).persistentContainer.viewContext

// Create a fetch request for the task to be updated
let fetchRequest: NSFetchRequest<Task> = Task.fetchRequest()
fetchRequest.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "title == %@", "Buy groceries")

do {
    // Execute the fetch request
    let tasks = try context.fetch(fetchRequest)
    
    // Update the task's title
    if let task = tasks.first {
        task.title = "Buy vegetables"
        
        // Save the changes
        do {
            try context.save()
        } catch {
            print("Error updating task: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    } else {
        print("Task not found")
    }
} catch {
    print("Error fetching tasks: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```
