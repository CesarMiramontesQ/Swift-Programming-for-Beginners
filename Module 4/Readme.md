## JSON and REST APIs

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is widely used in web applications. JSON is based on a subset of the JavaScript language, and it can be used to represent complex data structures such as arrays and dictionaries. 

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services that use HTTP protocols to interact with clients. RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide a way for developers to access and manipulate data over the internet.

In this section, students will learn how to work with JSON data and RESTful APIs in Swift, including how to make HTTP requests using the URLSession framework.

## Networking with URLSession

The URLSession framework provides a way for iOS and macOS applications to interact with web services. With URLSession, developers can make HTTP requests to remote servers, download data asynchronously, and handle errors and timeouts.

In this section, students will learn how to use URLSession to make HTTP requests, handle responses, and parse JSON data.

## Parsing JSON data

Once data has been downloaded from a web service, it must be parsed and converted into a format that can be used by the application. In Swift, this often involves decoding JSON data into objects or structs that can be used to display information in the app's user interface.

In this section, students will learn how to parse JSON data using Swift's built-in `JSONDecoder` class, as well as how to handle errors that may occur during the decoding process.

## Core Data and Persistent Storage

Core Data is a framework provided by Apple for managing persistent storage in iOS and macOS applications. Core Data allows developers to define data models and relationships between objects, and it provides a way to save and retrieve data from a local database.

In this section, students will learn how to use Core Data to manage data in their applications, including how to define data models, perform fetch requests, and save data to the local database.
